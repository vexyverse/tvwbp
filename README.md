The Vexyverse Website Building Principles

## Introduction

In recent years, I've seen web development techniques spread exponentially every day.  
In that case, there was a big problem in choosing technologies.  
In this article I will explain how to correctly choose the health technology for your own project.

### > *Size of the project*

The size of the project is very important in choosing the technology, for example:
Your project uses a specific and small block or a small project that may be used by a maximum of 100 people and you do not need techniques with high features. In this case, try to choose techniques to implement the project in the least time and without complexity. As an example, you can use a framework that includes the client and server side in the same project to make it more clear. I use Next.js for small projects and you don't have to use the exact same. You can search for something similar on the Internet.

As for projects that are large or are developed frequently, I recommend working on technologies that support the micro-service architecture to be developed independently by different work teams and this applies to both the client side and the server side.
